SPEC-PLACEHOLDER-001 — Lint placeholder HTML comment blocks in spec files.

The cross-link checker (``check-spec-cross-links.py``) ignores links inside
``<spec-placeholder>...</spec-placeholder>`` blocks (and, for backward
compatibility, the older ``<!-- TODO|FIXME ... -->`` HTML-comment form)
so authors can stash pending references without breaking CI. The
trade-off is that *malformed* placeholder blocks (missing markers,
broken bullet rows, stray text) silently slip through — the very rot
the placeholder was supposed to prevent.

This script validates every placeholder block of either supported
format, per the conventions in ``spec/_template.md``
§"Placeholder cross-references":

    <spec-placeholder reason="activate when target is created">
    - [Target Title](../NN-module-name/00-overview.md)
    - [Target Title](../NN-module-name/01-file-name.md#section-anchor)
    </spec-placeholder>

    <!-- legacy form, still supported -->
    <!-- TODO: activate when target is created
    - [Target Title](../NN-module-name/00-overview.md)
    - [Target Title](../NN-module-name/01-file-name.md#section-anchor)
    -->

Rules enforced (lightweight, no AST):

  P-001  Placeholder *intent text* must be a complete imperative
         sentence so reviewers see actionable language. Specifically:

           * Wording follows the marker (``TODO:`` / ``FIXME:`` for
             legacy comments, ``reason="…"`` for ``<spec-placeholder>``).
           * It must be non-empty and start with a recognised
             imperative verb (``activate``, ``add``, ``link``,
             ``replace``, ``wire``, ``update``, ``write``, ``create``,
             ``document``, ``cross-reference``). Extend the allowlist
             via ``--allow-verb <verb>`` (repeatable).
           * It must end with a period — half-sentences like
             ``activate later`` are rejected; ``Activate when target is
             created.`` passes.

         The verb is matched case-insensitively. Articles/auxiliaries
         like ``please`` are stripped before the check so
         ``please add the link.`` passes.
  P-002  Every non-blank body line must be a markdown bullet
         (``- [text](link)``) — no stray prose, no orphan list markers.
  P-003  Bullet links must be relative paths ending in ``.md``
         (optionally with ``#anchor``); ``http(s)://`` and bare anchors
         are rejected because placeholders are meant for *future*
         internal targets, not external references.
  P-004  Block must contain at least one bullet (empty placeholders are
         dead code).
  P-005  Block must not contain blank lines (keeps the snippet
         contiguous per template guidance).
  P-006  Every opening marker must have a matching closer
         (``-->`` or ``</spec-placeholder>``).
  P-007  Two or more placeholder bullets must not point at the same
         target ``.md`` file (anchor ignored — duplicates pointing at
         different sections of the same file still collapse to one
         pending activation). Detected within a file and across files.

Only multi-line comment blocks that start with the ``TODO:``/``FIXME:``
marker on the opening line are linted. Single-line comments and
non-placeholder comments (e.g. licence headers) are left alone. The
``<spec-placeholder>`` form is *always* linted because the tag itself
declares intent.

Exit codes:
  0  = no malformed placeholder blocks
  1  = one or more violations found
  2  = invocation error

    Two input modes:
      * ``diff_base`` → invoke
        ``git diff --name-status -M -C --diff-filter=AMRCD
        <base>...HEAD`` from ``repo_root``. The triple-dot syntax
        compares HEAD against the merge-base with ``<base>``, which
        matches GitHub's PR diff and survives force-pushes / rebases
        on the base branch. The ``AMRCD`` filter keeps Added,
        Modified, Renamed, Copied, *and* Deleted paths. Deletes are
        never linted (a deleted file can't carry a new violation in
        the post-state) but they ARE recorded in the audit trail
        with status ``ignored-deleted`` so downstream consumers can
        see the full intake. For ``R``/``C`` rows we take the *new* path so
        the linter re-checks the file under its post-rename location
        — that's where the placeholder block lives now, and a rename
        commit often touches it (e.g. updated back-pointer hints).
        ``-M`` enables rename detection (default 50 % similarity)
        and ``-C`` enables copy detection so the new sibling of a
        copy is also linted.
      * ``changed_files`` → read newline-delimited paths from the
        given file (``-`` = stdin). Blank lines and ``#`` comments are
        ignored. Useful for CI runners that compute the diff
        themselves (e.g. ``dorny/paths-filter``) or for local testing
        without a git invocation. Renames may be expressed on a
        single line as either ``OLD\\tNEW`` (tab-separated, matches
        ``git diff --name-status`` output verbatim) or
        ``OLD => NEW`` (matches ``git status -s`` rename arrows). In
        both forms the OLD path is discarded and the NEW path is
        linted as a normal change. A ``D\\tpath`` row in this input
        is recorded as ``ignored-deleted`` in the audit trail.

    ``audit`` (optional out-parameter): when provided, every path the
    intake considered is appended as a :class:`_ChangedFileAudit` row
    classified by extension/root/existence/delete-status. Pass
    ``None`` (the default) to skip the bookkeeping entirely — the
    legacy hot path stays allocation-free.

    Returned paths are absolute + resolved and filtered to:
      * extension ``.md``
      * residing under ``root`` (so a README change doesn't trigger a
        spec scan)
      * actually present on disk (a Modified path that was reverted
        in a later commit of the same push won't exist)

    When ``deleted`` is provided and a row is recognisable as a

    emits), the path is captured into ``deleted`` and the row is
    NOT forwarded to the caller. Without ``deleted`` (the default),
    such a row falls through to the generic tab-form branch and the
    bare path travels downstream to be filtered by extension/root
    checks — same end result as before this audit-trail addition.

    Plain paths (no tab, no ``=>``) pass through unchanged. Comments

      "new" path), we keep the column count intact and pick the
      last non-empty field. Quoted fields are unquoted; trailing
      CR is stripped.
    * Arrow rows: the regex no longer requires ``\\S`` at the path
      boundaries, so a path with a leading/trailing space round-
      trips correctly. The ``new`` group is unquoted to match what
      a user pasted from ``git status``.

# to "no diff context available" if the line isn't part of the
