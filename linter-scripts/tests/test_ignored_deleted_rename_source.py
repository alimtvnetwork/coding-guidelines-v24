"""Tests for the rename-source refinement of ``ignored-deleted``.

When a path is captured as a delete (either ``D\\tpath`` from
``git diff --name-status`` or from a ``--changed-files`` payload)
AND the same path also appears as the OLD side of a rename or
copy in the same intake, the audit row's ``reason`` must surface
the more accurate "rename-source" wording naming the NEW path —
not the misleading "file removed" text.

The fix is a pure audit-reason refinement: it does NOT change
which files get linted (the rename's NEW path is still linted as
a normal change, the OLD path is still recorded as
``ignored-deleted``). Only the human-readable ``reason`` cell
changes — and only for the cross-referenced rows.

Three layers of coverage:

1. **Unit-level** — :func:`_resolve_deleted_reason` directly,
   covering the rename-source hit, the legacy fall-through, the
   ``None`` similarities map, and the empty-``old_path`` edge case.
2. **End-to-end via --changed-files** — subprocess invocation
   with a manifest containing both ``D\\told`` and a separate
   ``R\\told\\tnew`` row, asserting the JSON audit reason names
   the new path.
3. **Regression guard** — a manifest with ONLY a delete (no
   matching rename) keeps the legacy reason byte-for-byte.
