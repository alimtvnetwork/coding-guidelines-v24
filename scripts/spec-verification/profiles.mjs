/**
 * profiles.mjs — Folder profiles for the verification injector.
 *
 * Each profile defines:
 *   - tag:     short prefix used in AC IDs (e.g. AC-DB-002)
 *   - title:   (slug) => H3 title text
 *   - given:   (slug) => Given clause
 *   - when:    static When clause (action verb)
 *   - then:    (slug) => Then clause (machine-checkable assertion)
 *   - commandKeys: list of keys into ``COMMAND_TEMPLATES``. Composed with
 *                  `&&` to produce the final shell command. This keeps the
 *                  command surface centralised — one edit in the registry
 *                  propagates to every profile that uses the template.
 *
 * Adding a folder profile is the only change needed to onboard a new spec
 * top-level folder. Keep bodies short — one Given/When/Then triple per
 * file is the design budget.
