# 00 — Overview: Main / Worker Service Architecture

**Spec:** `19-main-worker-service`
**Version:** 1.1.0
**Updated:** 2026-05-06
**Default stack:** Laravel (PHP) — stack-agnostic by design.

## 0. Mental Model — Kubernetes-style Control Plane

Treat this topology as a **lightweight Kubernetes analogy**:

| Kubernetes concept | This spec's analogue |
|---|---|
| Control plane (api-server + scheduler) | **Main Server** — catalog, routing, admission, push-update fan-out |
| Worker node (kubelet) | **Worker Server** — runs all business logic under its own split-DB |
| Pod scheduling | Tenant→Worker assignment via `04-worker-routing.md` |
| Node heartbeat / `kubelet → api-server` | Worker `POST /Heartbeat` to Main |
| `kubectl apply` / push deploy | Power-Admin push-update (`16-update-channels.md` §2) |
| Reconciliation loop / desired state | Worker pull-update poll loop (`16-update-channels.md` §3) |
| Image registry pull | Worker fetching release zip from a known URL (`16-update-channels.md` §4) |

Three update channels exist (full spec in `16-update-channels.md`):

1. **Pull from Main (Kubernetes-style reconciliation)** — Worker periodically polls `GET /API/V1/SelfUpdate/Desired` on Main; if the desired version differs from its running version, Worker self-updates from a Main-issued URL. Always available.
2. **Pull from a known release URL** — Worker reads its `UpdateSourceUrl` (Seedable-Config) and fetches the latest release JSON+zip directly. Used as Main-independent fallback.
3. **Push from Main (dev/debug only)** — Power Admin uploads a zip and Main fans it out to Workers. **Disabled in production** (`Env=Production` rejects the endpoint with HTTP 403). Allowed when `Env ∈ {Development, Debug, Staging}`.

The Main↔Worker relationship is **declarative**: Main stores desired state, Workers reconcile toward it. The push channel is an explicit override for dev/staging convenience.

Define a two-tier server topology where a **Main Server** acts as a coordinator (Kubernetes-master analogy) and one or more **Worker Servers** hold all business logic. The Main serves the UI and the React frontend's edge endpoints; Workers do the heavy lifting under their own split-DB.

This spec is the contract any implementer (AI or human) follows to build the topology. Details live in numbered files `01-`…`09-`. Diagrams live in `diagrams/`.

## 2. Scope

| In scope | Out of scope |
|----------|--------------|
| Main↔Worker topology, routing, auth handshake | Split-DB internals (see `spec/05-split-db-architecture/`) |
| Tenant→Worker mapping in main DB | Seedable-Config internals (see `spec/06-seedable-config-architecture/`) |
| Push-update mechanism (main → worker) | Self-update mechanism (pointer only — see `09-self-update-pointer.md`) |
| Role model + `User has access to {EnumPage}` pattern | Generic error handling (see `spec/03-error-manage/`) |
| Core API endpoint surface | Per-endpoint business logic |

---

## 3. Stack Flexibility (READ THIS)

The default reference implementation is **Laravel (PHP)**. Every rule in this spec is written stack-agnostically.

> **Future stacks explicitly supported:** .NET, Go (Golang), Python, Node.js, additional PHP frameworks (e.g., Symfony, raw PHP), WordPress as a host.

Implementer obligations regardless of stack:
1. Implement the same REST API surface (`06-core-api-endpoints.md`).
2. Honor the same auth contract (`05-auth-and-2fa.md`).
3. Use the same main-DB schema (`03-main-db-schema.md`) — column names PascalCase, PKs `{TableName}Id INTEGER AUTOINCREMENT`, no UUIDs.
4. Use the same error contract (`08-error-contract.md`) for main↔worker calls.

If a stack-specific deviation is unavoidable, document it in that stack's `99-consistency-report.md` and link back here.

---

## 4. Tenant Root Model

**Decision:** Company-as-root.

- Top-level entity: `Company`.
- A `Company` has many `User`s.
- Worker assignment is per-`Company`. All users of a company route to the same worker.
- Single-user products are modeled as `1 Company : 1 User` (degenerate case). No schema change.

Rationale: matches the verbatim's worked example (`POST /API/V1/Company`, "company-to-worker mapping"). See `plan.md` §Decisions.

---

## 5. Two-Tier Topology (one-paragraph version)

**Main Server** serves the React UI, holds a thin SQLite catalog (workers, tenant→worker map, versions), and routes business requests. It runs **no** business logic. **Worker Servers** are independent deployments of the same backend stack; each owns a split-DB (Root / App / Session per `spec/05-split-db-architecture/`) and runs all business logic. Both tiers ship with auth, 2FA, session, sign-up, sign-in, and JWT/cookie support out of the box; only the Main serves UI.

Full diagrams in `diagrams/` and details in `01-architecture.md`.

## 7. Compliance References

This spec inherits and does not redefine:

- `.lovable/coding-guidelines/coding-guidelines.md` — function length, zero-nesting, positive booleans, PascalCase, enum-for-Type/Status/Category/Kind
- `spec/04-database-conventions/` — DB schema rules (PascalCase, `{TableName}Id`, no UUIDs)
- `spec/05-split-db-architecture/` — worker-side split-DB
- `spec/06-seedable-config-architecture/` — config seeding for both tiers
- `spec/03-error-manage/` — generic error rules
